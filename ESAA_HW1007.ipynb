                  They also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .\\n25

it was fine .\\n29

more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .\\n32                                                                                                                                              However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service   .\\n33

                                                           Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n38

           30am, service finished at 11am, there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring ,  the ingredients seemed poor quality .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                      Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n41

                                               There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it

                                                                                                                                                                                           But there are

  on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

was very quiet .\\n34

Upon arriving late through no fault of our own and finding our room double booked we were put up in a nearby sister hotel   until our room was ready the next day and they give us a complimentary bottle of champagne ,  after this though there were no more snags and everything went great ,  hotel staff friendly and helpful ,  rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again\\n133

more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .\\n32                                                                                                                                              However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service   .\\n33

                                                           Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n38

.\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                              30am, service finished at 11am, there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring ,  the ingredients seemed poor quality .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                      Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n41

                             , but after I called room service it was promptly fixed .\\n42

ask room service for them if you need them .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                       There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                                                           But there are

minutes .\\n63

  on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                  Service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

driver seat is still soft and mostly uncomfortable .\\n13                                                                                                                                  The ride is comfortable and it seems to ride a little higher than the average sedan, which I like .\\n14                                                                                                                                            I've had 3 BMWs and only one of them could offer a more comfortable ride than the Camry .\\n15

                                                                      The previous soft seats were replaced with hard cheap ones which are very very uncomfortable and give me back pain .\\n17                                                                                                                                             If you keep in mind that the Camry is a comfort car, you may even enjoy the experience .\\n18                                                                                                         While the 4 cylinder does not have the punch of the Honda Accord 4 cylinder, the comfort and quietness of the ride won out .\\n19

                                                             I feel uncomfortable driving this car and will get rid of it .\\n21

                                                                                                                            This car offers poor driver's seat comfort, poor vision  , only average ride quality, gas mileage \\n24                                                                        We have had this Camry about two years now, and it is not a boring car but it is smooth, comfortable and has good road manner, and overall it is a good car .\\n25                                                                                                                          I'd highly

                                                 You can not get that comfort with any other automaker other than perhaps Honda .\\n27

                                                                                                                  I needed a comfortable commuter that I could also run around with the family in .\\n29

stiff suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33

                                                           I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                       The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                  Very comfortable ride and seating .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                 Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47

   Seats are padded more firmly than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49                                                                                                                                                           Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .\\n50

generation .\\n53                                                                                                                     It looks awesome, turns like it's on rails, has a great sound

                                                  The seats are way to low to the ground making long drives uncomfortable .\\n74

                                                                        Toyota made many improvements since 03, including more comfortable front seats, better rear seat room and comfort   .\\n76

straight forward and the take off power is quite impressive .\\n78

longer trips, however, they have a tendency to fall asleep, , which I think emphasizes how comfortable, smooth, and quiet it is .\\n80

             I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 The navigation works flawlessly, comfortable seats .\\n83                                                                                                                                                                 I have to say the car rode great,comfortable and gas mileage great .\\n84                                                                                                                                   I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a comfortable ride as well as good fuel economy .\\n85                                                                                                                             The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                   Comfortable and quiet with excellent gas mileage

expected  , compared to my 1999 Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91                                                                                                                                                              The window sill is too high and the armrest too low to be comfortable .\\n92                                                                                                        The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95                                                                                                                                                                                            It is so comfortable and drives perfect .\\n96                                                                                                              Overall this car is very quiet, comfortable, smooth, powerful, and absolutly the best mid, size in the current market .\\n97                                                                                                                                                                           Leather seats are comfortable, Nav system is easy to use .\\n98                                                                I only have a vibration shimmy problem at 70 mph, visited dealer three times and ended up with changing a new tire and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .\\n99                                                                                                                                                                                                     Leather seats were comfortable .\\n100                                                                                                                                                                                                 Leather interior very comfortable .\\n101                                                                                                                                My conclusion after doing a ton of research regarding safety, reliability, comfort and gas mileage :\\n102                                                                                                                           the Hyundai Sonata is thousands of dollars cheaper and matches the Camry in all respects except comfort .\\n103                                                                                        Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104                                                                                                                                                While the '03 was roomy and comfortable, the steering and handling were very vague .\\n105                           The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature,

improving .\\n32                                                                                                                                        the variable cylinder management changes to 4 cyl when not under load, this helps with fuel mileage .\\n33                                                                                                                                               After owning a Honda Accord EX   I had to go back to the Honda the gas mileage can't be beat .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                             Gas mileage is around 22, 23 in town and 29, 30 on the highway .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                   Fuel mileage has been less than expected .\\n36                                                                                                                                                     It's no 8 cylinder GT, but it also gets double the gas mileage and so far, no problems .\\n37                                                                                                                              Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .\\n38                                                                                                                                                          The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage .\\n39                                                                                                                                                  So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .\\n40                                                                                                                                                     The car is getting great gas mileage   even though I have only been driving it 2 weeks .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                           Our 2008 Accord is very disappointing, our in town mileage is 14 .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                Gets great gas mileage, I mostly drive city and I am currently receiving 25 .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                       I just love the VCM makes the car give great mileage .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                  Don't buy this car if you want good gas mileage .\\n46                                                                                                  I have a V, 6 with Variable Cylinder Management which is supposed to let the car run on 3,4 or 6 cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                             My BMW 530i got better mileage .\\n48                                                                                                   It is fun to

driving .\\n51                                                                                                                             I had tons of room in my 4Runner, but I needed something that would get better gas mileage w o giving up power .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                             I am so very disappointed with the gas mileage !\\n53

                                                                                                                              It feels safe, performs well, looks fantastic and gets decent gas mileage for its size .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                   The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                   Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable .\\n58

                                                                                                                    Gas mileage is horrible too, 20 mpg city highway after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74

keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76

drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80

                                  It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83

      This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS .\\n1

enjoyable desktop experience .\\n2

                                                                                                                                                                  They showed me PC laptops that had more features than the MacBook, and which cost way less than the MacBook, too .\\n4

.\\n5                                                                                                                                               If you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that .\\n6                                                                                                                                  After seeing the pricing on the newest MacBooks this week, and the limited features compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC .\\n7

                                                                                                     Also there are some other new things such as touch gesture features and disk encryption that normal users won't use either because it isn't needed or the hardware isn't widely adopted yet   .\\n9

                                                         But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers .\\n11

                   Also in Windows Explorer, two new features .\\n12

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , then Vista, but if so, none of its features have been impressive enough to have blown me away .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              It does have some nice features .\\n15                                                                                                                                                                                                                 W7 is fast and resource friendly, every hardware device works perfect  , and there's a ton of great features .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Runs well, but no stand out new features for my usage .\\n17                                                                                                                                                                         Having used Windows ME and XP for several years, and before upgrading, Vista, I heard a lot of great things about Windows 7, as well as new features .\\n18                                                                                                                                                                              I liked the built, in features of Vista and of course the appearance, but I prefered the stability and speed of XP even with a high, end system .\\n19

mouse gesture to the bottom right of the screen .\\n20

                                                                They're features I don't use .\\n22                                                                                                        Windows 7 Ultimate is there too off course, but I personally can't bring myself to spend that much more money just to get a tiny few features that I know I will never use like multi, language support and BitLocker .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             It's loaded with useful features .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                                                 It has some features that I personally don't find useful, BUT if in the future I do need them, they're there .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  There are many features that allow me to personalize my working environment .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Vista has more features than XP, but many of them didn't make the OS more usable for me .\\n27   Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                             I haven't yet become accustomed to some features like Aero Shake, but hey, those things are there if I need them .\\n29                                                                     I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .\\n30

files associated with that feature remain on the hard, drive taking up space .\\n46                                                                                                                                                          I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used

just a lack of some features that i had before .\\n49

pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .\\n51

from the upgrade .\\n52

option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n54

to force the user to use the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .\\n56

                           A lot of the new finder desktop windows features are awkward working versions of what Mac OS X has had for a couple of years or more .\\n58                                                                                                    If you didn't come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool, so enjoy them for what they are if you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .\\n59

     Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                There was a massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21

the hotel on Cromwell   Gloucester Rds .\\n22                                                                                                                                                       Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n23

           You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .\\n24

decent little cafes and shops to get either full breakfasts or breakfast foods .\\n27

   There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .\\n29

as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n30

                                Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so

recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

                                                   The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

                                             Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .\\n68

scotch were very reasonably priced always !\\n69

                                                                                                                                                                                   Another good thing is

fraction of the cost .\\n72

were outstanding portions are large and we shared since we are not big eaters .\\n3

onsite so I can't vouch for the food options immediately avialable .\\n5

snacks, so stop at a nearby market before going in for the night .\\n6

                                     But the presentation was awesome and the food was so good and not having to walk in the dark at night and scare my mother or pay for a taxi or bus, but sit around and eat comfortably in my pajamas was well worth the cost to me .\\n8

          For self catering types, Bockwinkels is a well stocked mini grocery 2 blocks south and 1 block east on street level for snacks, drinks and all kinds of deli prepared foods, plus the Aon

bother, as food outlets a few minutes walk away .\\n11

was fantastic and well worth the $40 pp .\\n12

the hotel and you will be charged .\\n13

food tends to be mediocre .\\n14

of the level and knowledge I would expect at at 5, star hotel .\\n42                                                     One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                       They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .\\n46                                                                                                                             We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   We were very impressed with the service we received .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The concierge service is second to none .\\n49                                                                                                                                          Tuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .\\n50                                                                                                                                               We found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                    Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                              very clean,well maintained,with efficient,if not overly friendly service .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                          The hotel makes a big thing of the coffee bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice .\\n54

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                      Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                      There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service .\\n58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The service in the hotel was really good .\\n59                                                                                                                                                     The restaurant in the hotel ,  Cafe Pescatore ,  does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .\\n60                                                                                                         Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .\\n61                                                                                                                           However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1, 4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service .\\n62

thought it was nice that it was available if needed .\\n63                                                                                                                      We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, we chose to eat at the IHOP around the corner for breakfast and it was good food and service, and they are open 24 hours .\\n64

               A masseur was giving guests a massage at the same location, not sure if there was a charge involved for that service, as there was no information about that anywhere .\\n74   The hotel is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use of this to purchase our breakfast requirements, as we had not had great service from the adjoining cafe Pescatore for our evening meal and thought we would do our own thing each morning .\\n75

                                              service was extra good, very friendly and there is a great cafe across the street   which has the best breakfast in the world .\\n81

                             From reading other reviews, it seems as though this hotel has significant lapses in service from time to time .\\n83

think it warmed up even with the heat on until the next day .\\n56

the morning which got you off to a great start for the day .\\n58

                                             Nothing disappointed us about our stay and we didn\\u0092t even take advantage of the free wine tasting between 5, 6pm .\\n61

make use of the free tea and coffee when we had an early start .\\n62

                                       Another great thing about the hotel is that every day, they offer wine and beer from 5, 6pm for free for all hotel guests .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                      Then we picked up the free lobby coffee and the WSJ and the USA Today newspapers, thus having a cheap breakfast .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                 We particularly enjoyed the nightly 'manager's reception' when wine and nibbles are freely available !\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                      The nightly free wine reception is a great way to meet people and find out what is worth seeing and what is not .\\n68

are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n70                                                                                                                                                   The staff were friendly and the free coffee and biscoti each morning and wine at 6pm each evening were occassions when one could meet other guests .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                      The hotel provides free hot drinks and biscotti in the mornings, which was good quality but why ?\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Free wine and mingle from 5 to 6pm .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                          It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                   There was a free wine tasting that the hotel put on that we were, unfortunately, too jet, lagged to participate in .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                    Every evening 5pm to 6pm, guests are invited to have free wine in the reception area and there is free coffee there every morning .\\n76    The hotel's evening wine hour and morning's biscotti hour also distinguish the property as a cut above, and our group, which has stayed at many a biz hotel, had no problem whatsoever  in fact, a courtesy upgrade got us a fine meeting space with free internet, which even impressed our boss .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The great thing for us was the free parking .\\n78                                                                                                                                                           We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .\\n79                                                                                                                                                                               Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially

       Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n41

There are no bottle openers or cork screws in the room so ask room service for them if you need them .\\n43

                                                     But there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff .\\n46

enough, and I was given a room with a nice view of central London   on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

is suppose to be a full service hotle, but I would only classify it at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n72

be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

to inform us about a transit strike on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50 pounds plus banking holiday surcharge, , we luckily found a cheaper alternative by ourselves .\\n136

                                      Its location is probably the first thing worth mentioning, being a 10 minutes walk from the natural history museum, a 15 minutes walk from beautiful Hyde Park and

of our own and finding our room double booked we were put up in a nearby sister hotel   until our room was ready the next day and they give us a complimentary bottle of champagne ,  after this though there were no more snags and everything went great ,  hotel staff friendly and helpful ,  rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again\\n133

service was very very inefficient ,  requesting a menu to be brought to the room took 45 minutes and the guy actually had the audacity to suggest he read it to me over the phone instead of sending one up, after I had to call three times .\\n481

  One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything

                                At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour

              We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47

                                                                                                                                          I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n55

breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .\\n60                                                                                                         Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .\\n61

there is little reason to order room service .\\n62

                                                    We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, we chose to eat at the IHOP around the corner for breakfast and it was good food and service, and they are open 24 hours .\\n64

for that service, as there was no information about that anywhere .\\n74   The hotel is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use of this to purchase our breakfast requirements, as we had not had great service from the adjoining cafe Pescatore for our evening meal and thought we would do our own thing each morning .\\n75

                                                         Parking is crazy expensive, we drove up from LA so we had a car ,  but otherwise, you really don't need it .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is expensive   and everything is very much within walking distance .\\n20                                                                                                                                             Valet parking is, in my view, unreasonably high at $38 per night, but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .\\n21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it\\u0092s cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  The hotel does have parking, but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                              Parking at $45 a night was outrageous, but probably worth it to keep your car safe .\\n25

to the hotel .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                       A lot of hotel parking garages lots are not on the same premises as the hotel in the area .\\n28

                                                                                                     Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31

Francisco .\\n32                                                                                                                                                     Valet parking was $45 per night with tax, but that includes in and out privileges and my car was there whenever I needed it .\\n33

                                                                                                                                                                                     This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Aside from the parking rate, you won't be disappointed .\\n36                                                                           The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Onsite parking is available .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                             I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .\\n39                                                                                              I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                            Valet parking is provided at $36 day which was, I thought, excessive .\\n41

valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .\\n43

                                                                                                                                                                                  Check for Internet

                               I do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .\\n46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\\n47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit

                                                             Several have mentioned the charge for parking .\\n51

hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n53

is $36 a night so getting that thrown in was a fantastic steal .\\n58                                                                                                                                      We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .\\n59

discount and free parking .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                           Nice rooms, a bit on the smaller side, but parking right at the hotel .\\n61

so we only had to pay the regular parking fee of the hotel .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                                               Way too much money to pay for parking, but that is the way it is in San Francisco .\\n64

                                                        all these hotels charge parking fees .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                  Parking at the hotel is expensive at $32 plus tax per night but the up side is that you have in out privilages .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Parking in the city is a royal pain !\\n68                                                                                                                                                        Although the parking charge is steep, it seems to be the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :\\n69                                                                                                           I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .\\n70               All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over .\\n71

Parking is an issue in SF so either pay the $30 .\\n73                                                                                      In addition, the valet parking is apparently handled by an outside contractor, and turned out to be considerably more expensive than we had been told ,  $35 day ,  which seemed very high .\\n74

one day .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                  You'll be having fun while some other poor sod is looking for a parking space that isn't there .\\n76

                                                                                                                                                             I thought the $29 per day parking was ridiculous, but I hear that's the standard in SF .\\n78                                                                                                                     Upon arriving, there was a very long and confusing to do with the valet parking ,  we hadn't gotten our luggage out of th car and the valet wanted the keys .\\n79

                                                Valet parking attendant was no better .\\n81

The Tuscan is $29 night, but if you search for a package rate on their web site, you may get parking included in your room rate .\\n84
